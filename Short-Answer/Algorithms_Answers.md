## Exercise I

a) `a=0` is O(1), so we can ignore it. The `while` loop is the import part. After the first iteration of the `while` loop, `a` equals n<sup>2</sup>; after the second iteration, it equals n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>2</sup> or 2n<sup>2</sup>, then 3n<sup>2</sup>, and so on. The loop ends when `a` reaches n<sup>3</sup>--i.e., n * n<sup>2</sup>. This happens after n iterations. Hence, **the runtime complexity is O(n)**.


b)
